        My favorite place is Disney World because it's the most magical and most fun
        place to be on Earth. When I was a child I used to go to Disney World every 
        summer with my family. I had the best time riding all of the rides and experiencing 
        everything Disney has to offer. I also thought that Disney world was very magical
        making every ride the best experience ever. I love all of the restaurants as
        each one has it's one disney theme making me feel I'm right in the movies.
        I love this place and I hope to go back here again.</p>

      <h2>The Unexpected</h2>
      <p>Something no one would expect of me is that I started watching anime for the
        first time sophomore year of college and I have a list of all the anime I have
        watched in ranking order. Also the list consist of 100+ anime that I have all
        completed and ranked form best to worst all in a span of 2 years.
